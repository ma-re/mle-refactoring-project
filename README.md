# Refactoring Project

In this repository you can find my first MLE project.

## Setup

The necessary libraries are listed in the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file. You can install them with the following command:

```bash
pyenv local 3.11.3
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
